# CfG Project Candidates

This repository houses a wiki of project candidates gathered at CfG meetings. You can view the wiki [here](https://github.com/codeforgso/project-candidates/wiki).

We're using the issue tracker to organize project ideas. To file one yourself, create an issue and label it "[project-submission](https://github.com/codeforgso/project-candidates/labels/project-submission)". Later, we'll be adding some sort of voting system to direct our resources.
